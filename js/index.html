    <h1>Intro to JS</h1>
    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia,
        animate images, and much more.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
        JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class
        functions.</p>
    <p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables
        interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it, and
        major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.</p>
    <p>As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It
        has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data
        structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
